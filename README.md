A collection of resources as Assets, Helpers, & Widgets for Yii2.

This package replaces my yii2-asset-collection, including in all my other projects which had yii2-asset-collection as a dependancy.

Installation
------------

The preferred way to install p2y2-things is through [composer](http://getcomposer.org/download/).
Depending on your composer installation, run *one* of the following commands:

```
composer require p2made/yii2-p2y2-things ">=1.4.2"
```

or

```
php composer.phar require p2made/yii2-p2y2-things ">=1.4.2"
```

Alternatively add:

```
	"p2made/yii2-p2y2-things": ">=1.4.2"
```

to the requires section of your `composer.json` file & p2y2-things will be installed next time you run `composer update`.

A kitchen-sink full of CSS & JS resources wrapped as Yii2 AssetBundles. See [assets documentation](docs/P2Y2Assets) for detail & usage.
